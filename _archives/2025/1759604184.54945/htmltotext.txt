However, the opaque nature of these models raises concerns about transparency, accountability, and robustness. This workshop aims to advance research in explainability for machine learning and sequential decision-making by exploring methodologies to interpret model-driven decisions, understand causal mechanisms, and ensure fairness and reliability in real-world use cases. Submission Deadline: 18th May, 2025, 11:59 PM (AoE) . The workshop will be held on 26th May in Calgary .
