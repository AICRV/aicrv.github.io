Machine learning and sequential decision making systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the opaque nature of these models raises concerns about transparency, accountability, and robustness. This workshop aims to advance research in explainability for machine learning and sequential decision-making by exploring methodologies to interpret model-driven decisions, understand causal mechanisms, and ensure fairness and reliability in real-world use cases.

    
    
    Submission Deadline: 18th May, 2025, 11:59 PM (AoE).
    
    The workshop will be held on  26th May in Calgary.
