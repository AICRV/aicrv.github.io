<p>
<span class="wixui-rich-text__text"><span class="backcolor_41 wixui-rich-text__text">A3.</span></span>&#xA0;We encourage you to submit separate abstracts.

Depending on how much funding we can secure, we will try to provide (partial) travel funding for selected accepted abstracts. There is no need to apply for this directly and all accepted abstract will be automatically considered. You can also apply for financial support to serve as Canadian AI volunteers.</p></div></p> <p class="font_8 wixui-rich-text__text"><span class="wixui-rich-text__text">&#x200B;</span></p> <p class="font_8 wixui-rich-text__text"><div class="color_36"><span class="wixui-rich-text__text"><span class="backcolor_41 wixui-rich-text__text">Q5.</span></span>&#xA0;I do not have an abstract accepted by GSS.
