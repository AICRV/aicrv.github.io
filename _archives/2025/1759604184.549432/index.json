                    "SpeakersThis page will showcase detailed information about the speakers featured at the Canadian AI and Robots & Vision Conference 2025. Learn more about our keynote speakers, as well as symposium and workshop speakers, who are leaders in artificial intelligence, robotics, and computer vision. Speaker bios, talk titles, abstract, and session times will be added as they are confirmed. Please check back regularly for updates as we finalize the speaker lineup.Canadian AI Conference Keynote SpeakersSageev Oore27 May 2025Professor Faculty of Computer Science at Dalhousie UniversityTalk title to be announcedBio\n\nSageev Oore is a faculty member in Computer Science at Dalhousie University, an Affiliate Faculty Member at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and a professional musician. Sageev works on fundamental deep learning research, particularly in relation to audio, music, computational creativity, mental health, and robustness. He works with clinicians to track depression severity through speech acoustics. He has held roles including Research Faculty Member at the Vector Institute, Canada CIFAR AI Chair, and Visiting Research Scientist at Google. His work has received awards and nominations at NeurIPS, AAAI, and CVPR. Sageev is grateful to collaborate with the wonderful graduate students in his lab, who make things work.\n\nAlongside his scientific pursuits, Sageev is a multiple award-winning musician. He has performed with orchestras as a classical soloist (e.g. Mozart, Chopin, Rachmaninoff concerti) and as an improviser. He has played with hundreds of musicians, at jazz festivals across the country, and collaborates in art and research (in different & fun proportions) with his siblings\u2014Daniel, Jasmine, and Jonathan.\n\nHe completed his undergraduate degree in Math (Dalhousie), MSc and PhD in Computer Science (University of Toronto) with Geoffrey Hinton, and studied piano with music teachers affiliated with Dalhousie, Juilliard, York, and UBC.Nathalie Japkowicz28 May 2025Professor, Department of Computer Science, American UniversityTalk title: Lifelong Learning for Anomaly Detection: An Emerging ParadigmAbstract\n\nAnomaly Detection is an important branch of machine learning whose purpose is to identify unusual instances or patterns in the data. It has great practical value as it helps identify errors or natural outliers, as well as faults in a system, fraudulent transactions, or malicious events. To date, Anomaly Detection has been mostly performed offline on static datasets or online on dynamic datasets. The offline version does not consider changes in the data while the online version proposes mechanisms for adapting to evolving data. A disadvantage of online Anomaly Detection, however, is that while adapting to new circumstances, it forgets old ones. This can be detrimental for fast-evolving domains with recurrent patterns, especially if timely responses are essential. It is particularly problematic in adversarial settings where the malicious agent can exploit this weakness. In this talk, we propose the Lifelong Anomaly Detection paradigm to address this shortcoming, along with pyCLAD, the software package we designed in parallel. We also present three approaches to lifelong anomaly detection designed in our lab: CPDGA, VLAD, and TropeFinder.\n\n\u200b\n\nBio\n\nNathalie Japkowicz is a professor in the Computer Science Department at American University, which she chaired from July 2018 to June 2024. Prior to that, she directed the Laboratory for Research on Machine Learning applied to Defense and Security at the University of Ottawa in Canada. She is a Professor and AI/Machine Learning researcher particularly interested in lifelong machine learning, anomaly detection, hate speech monitoring, machine learning evaluation, and the handling of uncharacteristic data including datasets plagued by class imbalances. She trained over 30 graduate students. Her research has been funded by American University\u2019s Signature Research Initiative, DARPA\u2019s L2M program, NSERC, DRDC, Health Canada, and various private companies. Her publications include Evaluating Learning Algorithms: A Classification Perspective at Cambridge University Press (2011), an edited book in the Springer Series on Big Data (2016), and over 150 book chapters, journal articles, and conference or workshop papers. Her recent co-authored book entitled Machine Learning Evaluation: Towards Reliable and Responsible AI at Cambridge University Press appeared in November 2024. She received five best paper awards, including the prestigious European Conference on Machine Learning 2014 Test of Time award, and was awarded the Canadian Artificial Intelligence Association Distinguished Service Award in 2021.Geoffrey Rockwell29 May 2025Philosophy and Digital Humanities, Canada CIFAR AI Chair, Amii Fellow, University of AlbertaTalk title: Moral Responsibility and AIAbstract\n\nThe Government of Canada and companies like Microsoft have organized their AI ethics under the rubric of \u201cResponsible AI\u201d but they don\u2019t define moral responsibility in a way that guide ethics initiatives. In this talk I will return to philosophical discussions of moral responsibility as participation in a moral commons and the ability to respond (response-ability) on ethical issues. I will review Strawson\u2019s widely discussed paper \u201cFreedom and Resentment\u201d and discuss what we can learn from it as we negotiate responsibly managed artificial intelligence.\n\n\u200b\n\nBio\n\nDr. Geoffrey Martin Rockwell is a Professor of Philosophy and Digital Humanities at the University of Alberta. He presently holds a Canada CIFAR AI Chair at the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute. He has a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Toronto and has published on subjects such as artificial intelligence and ethics, philosophical dialogue, textual visualization and analysis, digital humanities, instructional technology, computer games and multimedia. His books include Defining Dialogue: From Socrates to the Internet (Humanity Books, 2003) and Hermeneutica, co-authored with St\u00e9fan Sinclair (MIT Press, 2016). Hermeneutica is part of a hybrid text and tool project with Voyant Tools (voyant-tools.org), an award-winning suite of analytical tools. He recently co-edited Right Research: Modelling Sustainable Research Practices in the Anthropocene (Open Book Publishers, 2021) and On Making in the Digital Humanities (UCL Press, 2023).Conference on Robots and Vision Keynote SpeakersJulie A. AdamsOregon State UniversityTalk Title: The Human-Robot Ratio (m:N) Theory: Limitations and ConsiderationsAbstract\n\nThe traditional human-to-robot ratio, or m:N theory states that the number of robots limits humans ability to manage and maintain overall team performance. This theory was developed primarily based on ground robot capabilities 10-15 years ago. While some traditional m:N limitations persist, both applied research and commercial systems debunk this traditional theory, particularly for very large numbers of robots (m<<N). This keynote will discuss the limitations of the theory, provide evidence that contradicts the theory, and discuss human factors aspects that will have an impact on the number of robots a single human can safely deploy. Results and examples will include simulated large autonomous uncrewed aircraft with associated necessary interactions with air traffic control, heterogeneous swarms deployed in urban environments, and commercial delivery uncrewed aircraft.\n\n\u200b\n\nBio\n\nDr. Adams is the founder of the Human-Machine Teaming Laboratory and the Associate Director of Research of the Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CoRIS) Institute. Adams has focused on human-machine teaming and distributed artificial intelligence for thirty-five years.

However, we can further enhance robot operability in diverse environments (from air to land to marine) by augmenting the autonomous capabilities of single aerial, ground or surface vessels through cross-modal interactions. In this talk, we will discuss two different applications that benefit from cross-modality. Firstly, we explore how to leverage aerial robot imagery to enable GPS-denied, zero-shot autonomous navigation for ground vehicles in untraversed environments. Secondly, we explore how to co-ordinate autonomous aerial and surface vessels to enable the landing of aerial vehicles on surface vessels to recharge in remote marine or limnology applications. This is done by accommodating spatial and temporal uncertainties in the waves that can make landing challenging. These preliminary technologies have the potential to enable more persistent operation of robots in diverse environments.\n\n\u200b\n\nBio\n\nDr Melissa Greeff is an assistant professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Queen\u2019s University.
