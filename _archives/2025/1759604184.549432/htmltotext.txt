(japkowicz-1701-300.jpg)   (https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/japkowic.cfm) Nathalie Japkowicz     28 May 2025    Professor, Department of Computer Science, American University   Talk title: Lifelong Learning for Anomaly Detection: An Emerging Paradigm   Abstract  Anomaly Detection is an important branch of machine learning whose purpose is to identify unusual instances or patterns in the data. It has great practical value as it helps identify errors or natural outliers, as well as faults in a system, fraudulent transactions, or malicious events. To date, Anomaly Detection has been mostly performed offline on static datasets or online on dynamic datasets. The offline version does not consider changes in the data while the online version proposes mechanisms for adapting to evolving data. A disadvantage of online Anomaly Detection, however, is that while adapting to new circumstances, it forgets old ones. This can be detrimental for fast-evolving domains with recurrent patterns, especially if timely responses are essential. It is particularly problematic in adversarial settings where the malicious agent can exploit this weakness. In this talk, we propose the Lifelong Anomaly Detection paradigm to address this shortcoming, along with pyCLAD, the software package we designed in parallel. We also present three approaches to lifelong anomaly detection designed in our lab: CPDGA, VLAD, and TropeFinder. ​  Bio  Nathalie Japkowicz is a professor in the Computer Science Department at American University, which she chaired from July 2018 to June 2024.

Conference on Robots and Vision Keynote Speakers                   (adams.jpg)   (https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/hmtl/) Julie A. Adams     Oregon State University   Talk Title: The Human-Robot Ratio (m:N) Theory: Limitations and Considerations   Abstract  The traditional human-to-robot ratio, or m:N theory states that the number of robots limits humans ability to manage and maintain overall team performance. This theory was developed primarily based on ground robot capabilities 10-15 years ago. While some traditional m:N limitations persist, both applied research and commercial systems debunk this traditional theory, particularly for very large numbers of robots (m<<N). This keynote will discuss the limitations of the theory, provide evidence that contradicts the theory, and discuss human factors aspects that will have an impact on the number of robots a single human can safely deploy. Results and examples will include simulated large autonomous uncrewed aircraft with associated necessary interactions with air traffic control, heterogeneous swarms deployed in urban environments, and commercial delivery uncrewed aircraft. ​  Bio  Dr. Adams is the founder of the Human-Machine Teaming Laboratory and the Associate Director of Research of the Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CoRIS) Institute.

However, we can further enhance robot operability in diverse environments (from air to land to marine) by augmenting the autonomous capabilities of single aerial, ground or surface vessels through cross-modal interactions. In this talk, we will discuss two different applications that benefit from cross-modality. Firstly, we explore how to leverage aerial robot imagery to enable GPS-denied, zero-shot autonomous navigation for ground vehicles in untraversed environments. Secondly, we explore how to co-ordinate autonomous aerial and surface vessels to enable the landing of aerial vehicles on surface vessels to recharge in remote marine or limnology applications. This is done by accommodating spatial and temporal uncertainties in the waves that can make landing challenging. These preliminary technologies have the potential to enable more persistent operation of robots in diverse environments. ​  Bio  Dr Melissa Greeff is an assistant professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Queen’s University.
