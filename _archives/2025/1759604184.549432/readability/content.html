<p>Anomaly Detection is an important branch of machine learning whose purpose is to identify unusual instances or patterns in the data. It has great practical value as it helps identify errors or natural outliers, as well as faults in a system, fraudulent transactions, or malicious events. To date, Anomaly Detection has been mostly performed offline on static datasets or online on dynamic datasets. The offline version does not consider changes in the data while the online version proposes mechanisms for adapting to evolving data. A disadvantage of online Anomaly Detection, however, is that while adapting to new circumstances, it forgets old ones. This can be detrimental for fast-evolving domains with recurrent patterns, especially if timely responses are essential. It is particularly problematic in adversarial settings where the malicious agent can exploit this weakness. In this talk, we propose the Lifelong Anomaly Detection paradigm to address this shortcoming, along with pyCLAD, the software package we designed in parallel. We also present three approaches to lifelong anomaly detection designed in our lab: CPDGA, VLAD, and TropeFinder.</p>

<p>The Government of Canada and companies like Microsoft have organized their AI ethics under the rubric of “Responsible AI” but they don’t define moral responsibility in a way that guide ethics initiatives. In this talk I will return to philosophical discussions of moral responsibility as participation in a moral commons and the ability to respond (response-ability) on ethical issues. I will review Strawson’s widely discussed paper “Freedom and Resentment” and discuss what we can learn from it as we negotiate responsibly managed artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The traditional human-to-robot ratio, or m:N theory states that the number of robots limits humans ability to manage and maintain overall team performance. This theory was developed primarily based on ground robot capabilities 10-15 years ago. While some traditional m:N limitations persist, both applied research and commercial systems debunk this traditional theory, particularly for very large numbers of robots (m&lt;&lt;N). This keynote will discuss the limitations of the theory, provide evidence that contradicts the theory, and discuss human factors aspects that will have an impact on the number of robots a single human can safely deploy. Results and examples will include simulated large autonomous uncrewed aircraft with associated necessary interactions with air traffic control, heterogeneous swarms deployed in urban environments, and commercial delivery uncrewed aircraft.</p>

<p>The capabilities and the use of foundational (FM) and vision-language (VLM) models in computer vision have exploded over the past few years. This has led to a broad paradigm shift in the field. In this talk I will focus on the recent work from my group that navigates this quickly evolving research landscape. Addressing challenges such as building foundational models with better generalization, increasing their context length, adopting them to ever evolving task landscape and routing information among them for more complex reasoning visual problems. I will also discuss some curious benefits and challenges of working with such models, including emergent (localization) capabilities and in-consistency in their responses.</p>

<p>Single aerial robot systems can achieve high speed flight in challenging GPS-denied conditions enabling remote surveillance, package delivery and infrastructure inspection. However, we can further enhance robot operability in diverse environments (from air to land to marine) by augmenting the autonomous capabilities of single aerial, ground or surface vessels through cross-modal interactions. In this talk, we will discuss two different applications that benefit from cross-modality. Firstly, we explore how to leverage aerial robot imagery to enable GPS-denied, zero-shot autonomous navigation for ground vehicles in untraversed environments. Secondly, we explore how to co-ordinate autonomous aerial and surface vessels to enable the landing of aerial vehicles on surface vessels to recharge in remote marine or limnology applications. This is done by accommodating spatial and temporal uncertainties in the waves that can make landing challenging. These preliminary technologies have the potential to enable more persistent operation of robots in diverse environments.</p>

<p>As video data continues to grow exponentially in volume and complexity, the development of intelligent systems to manage and summarize videos has become a pressing need. Video abstraction, a key task in computer vision and video understanding, aims to create a short, informative visual summary of a video, enabling users to quickly gain valuable insights about the video without watching it entirely. With applications spanning entertainment, sports, surveillance, healthcare, and video search, this technology has the potential to transform how we interact with video content and unlock the full potential of video data. In this talk, I will discuss our recent research and innovative solutions leveraging deep learning to advance the state of the art in video abstraction.</p>
