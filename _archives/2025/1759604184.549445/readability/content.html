<h4>Location​​​​:</h4>

<p>The workshop will take place in Room EDT 314, on the third floor of the Education Tower at the University of Calgary (<span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/about/our-campuses/campus-maps-and-room-finder">Map</a></span>). The Education Tower is accessible through the Education Block, which faces the bus loop on the 24th Avenue side of Main Campus and from the Haskayne School of Business. The third floor is accessible via stairway in the Education Tower, or via elevator if you continue through to the Education Tower. The elevator bank faces our Graduate Programs Office on the main floor of the Tower - simply take the elevator to the third floor and turn right upon exiting.&nbsp;</p>
