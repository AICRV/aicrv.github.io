This workshop aims to explore the integration of multimodal inputs, particularly visual and textural data, into Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems to enhance their performance and applicability. By bringing together researchers and practitioners, we will discuss recent advancements, challenges, and future directions in Multimodal Natural Language Processing (MNLP) with a focus on ASR. ​ Traditional ASR systems primarily rely on acoustic signals to transcribe speech. However, human communication is inherently multimodal, often involving visual cues such as lip movements, gestures, and contextual imagery. Integrating these additional modalities can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of ASR systems, especially in noisy environments or when dealing with ambiguous linguistic content. This workshop seeks to: 

Highlight Recent Research: Present cutting-edge studies that incorporate visual/textural information into ASR, demonstrating improved performance and new capabilities.


Discuss Technical Challenges: Identify and address the technical hurdles in fusing multimodal data, such as synchronization, data representation, and model integration.


Explore Applications: Examine real-world applications where multimodal ASR offers significant advantages, including assistive technologies, human-computer interaction, and multimedia content analysis.


Foster Collaboration: Create a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers in speech processing, computer vision, and natural language processing.

 ​​ ​​ Workshop Highlights The workshop will be structured as a full-day event, comprising: 

Keynote Speeches: Invited talks from leading experts in multimodal ASR and MNLP.


Paper Presentations: Oral presentations of peer-reviewed research papers.


Poster Sessions: Interactive sessions for researchers to showcase their work and engage in detailed discussions.
