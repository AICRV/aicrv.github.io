This full-day event is designed for educators, researchers, and academic leaders, addressing key topics such as academic integrity, AI literacy, ethical considerations, and innovative teaching practices. Participants will gain insights into addressing biases in AI-driven tools, fostering interdisciplinary approaches, and bridging pedagogy with technology. ​  This workshop is hosted by theWerklund School of Education and the Centre for Artificial Intelligence Ethics, Literacy, and Integrity (CAIELI) . It is designed for educators, researchers, and industry professionals interested in AI’s integration into education. ​ ​  ​ ​  Workshop Highlights  Keynote Presentation: Dr. Phil Newton (Swansea University, UK)   Educator Testimonials : Real-world K-12 and post-secondary experiences with GenAI Panel Discussion: Opportunities and challenges of GenAI in schools Case Studies & Best Practices: Collaborative problem-solving on AI integration Hands-on Workshops: Training on AI tools for teaching and learning ​  ​  Organizers  Dr. Soroush Sabbaghan  Dr. Sarah Elaine Eaton  Dr. Barbara Brown  Dr. Mohammad Keyhani  Leeanne Morrow   ​  ​  Invited Speakers  Keynote: Dr. Phil Newton (Swansea University, UK)  K-12 Presenters:     Cameron Taylor, Connect Charter School   Sally Smith, Foothills School Division  Doug Stevens, Foothills School Division   Panelists:    Shannon Benett, Connect Charter School  Michelle Barager, Chinook’s Edge School Division  Kirk Linton, Calgary Chathotic School District  Sue Mylde – Rundle School   ​ ​  ​  Important Dates ​ Workshop Date: May 26, 2025    ​   ​  Workshop Structure (Draft Schedule)  9:00 AM – 9:30 AM | Registration and Networking Breakfast  9:30 AM – 10:15 AM | Keynote Presentation – Dr. Phil Newton  10:15 AM – 11:00 AM | Educator Testimonials – Real-World GenAI Applications  11:00 AM – 11:15 AM | Break  11:15 AM – 12:30 PM | Panel Discussion – Opportunities and Challenges of GenAI in Schools  12:30 PM – 1:30 PM | Lunch and Networking  1:30 PM – 3:00 PM | Case Studies and Best Practices – Collaborative group work  3:00 PM – 3:15 PM | Break  3:15 PM – 4:30 PM | Hands-On Workshops – AI Tools Showcase and Training  4:30 PM – 5:00 PM | Wrap-Up and Reflections     Location​​​​: The workshop will take place in Room EDT 314, on the third floor of the Education Tower at the University of Calgary ((https://www.ucalgary.ca/about/our-campuses/campus-maps-and-room-finder) Map  ). The Education Tower is accessible through the Education Block, which faces the bus loop on the 24th Avenue side of Main Campus and from the Haskayne School of Business. The third floor is accessible via stairway in the Education Tower, or via elevator if you continue through to the Education Tower. The elevator bank faces our Graduate Programs Office on the main floor of the Tower - simply take the elevator to the third floor and turn right upon exiting.  ​  If you are driving to campus, you have two lot options with daily rates: Lot 32 (the cheapest full day rate), or Lot 1 (the closest, physically, but the most expensive) - you can check out all of the lot details via (https://www.ucalgary.ca/ancillary/parking) Parking Services  . ​  Here is the Google Map Link to the Education Tower  : (https://maps.app.goo.gl/hFvJEJhwSu9ro3r99) https://maps.app.goo.gl/hFvJEJhwSu9ro3r99              This workshop aims to explore the integration of multimodal inputs, particularly visual and textural data, into Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems to enhance their performance and applicability. By bringing together researchers and practitioners, we will discuss recent advancements, challenges, and future directions in Multimodal Natural Language Processing (MNLP) with a focus on ASR. ​  Traditional ASR systems primarily rely on acoustic signals to transcribe speech. However, human communication is inherently multimodal, often involving visual cues such as lip movements, gestures, and contextual imagery. Integrating these additional modalities can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of ASR systems, especially in noisy environments or when dealing with ambiguous linguistic content. This workshop seeks to: Highlight Recent Research: Present cutting-edge studies that incorporate visual/textural information into ASR, demonstrating improved performance and new capabilities.  Discuss Technical Challenges: Identify and address the technical hurdles in fusing multimodal data, such as synchronization, data representation, and model integration.  Explore Applications: Examine real-world applications where multimodal ASR offers significant advantages, including assistive technologies, human-computer interaction, and multimedia content analysis.  Foster Collaboration: Create a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers in speech processing, computer vision, and natural language processing.   ​ ​  ​ ​  Workshop Highlights  The workshop will be structured as a full-day event, comprising: Keynote Speeches: Invited talks from leading experts in multimodal ASR and MNLP.  Paper Presentations: Oral presentations of peer-reviewed research papers.  Poster Sessions: Interactive sessions for researchers to showcase their work and engage in detailed discussions.  Panel Discussion:  A moderated discussion on the future directions of multimodal ASR, involving academia and industry experts.  Hands-on Tutorials: Practical sessions demonstrating tools and techniques for integrating multimodal data into ASR systems.   ​  ​  Target Audience  Researchers and Academics: Individuals working in ASR, computer vision, and MNLP.  Industry Professionals: Practitioners developing speech recognition applications and interested in multimodal integration.  Graduate Students: Students seeking to deepen their understanding of multimodal approaches in speech recognition.   ​  ​  ​ ​ ​ Call for Papers ​ We invite submissions on topics including, but not limited to: Multimodal Data Fusion: Techniques for combining audio and visual/textural data in ASR systems.  Model Architectures:  Innovative neural architectures for multimodal ASR.  Dataset Development: Creation and annotation of datasets containing synchronized audio and visual data.  Application Case Studies: Real-world implementations of multimodal ASR systems.  Evaluation Metrics: Methods for assessing the performance of multimodal ASR systems.   ​ ​   ​   Submission Guidelines    Paper Length: Long papers (up to 12 pages) and short papers (up to 6 pages), including references.  Format: Submissions should follow the conference's specified template.  Review Process: All submissions will undergo double-blind peer review.
