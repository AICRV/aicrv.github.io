Generally, reviewers can recognize plagiarism when they see it; it is unlikely that a reviewer will be uncertain whether plagiarism has occurred. Our policy on plagiarism is to refer suspected cases to the IEEE Intellectual Property office, which has an established mechanism for dealing with plagiarism and wide powers of excluding offending authors from future conferences and from IEEE journals. You can find information on this office, their procedures, and their definitions of five levels of plagiarism at&#xA0;</span><a href="https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/plagiarism/plagiarism.html" class="wixui-rich-text__text"><span class="color_41 wixui-rich-text__text"><span class="wixui-rich-text__text"><span class="wixui-rich-text__text">this link</span></span></span></a><span class="color_36 wixui-rich-text__text">.

Papers containing citations of non-existent material will be rejected when found, and may be desk-rejected. Similarly, papers containing obvious factual inaccuracies will be rejected when found and may be desk-rejected. If asked, authors must produce the prompts or other inputs to tools they used in the process of preparing the paper and the corresponding text that was generated by the tools.</span></p> <p class="font_8 wixui-rich-text__text"><span class="color_36 wixui-rich-text__text"><span class="wixGuard wixui-rich-text__text">&#x200B;</span></span></p> <p class="font_8 wixui-rich-text__text"><span class="color_36 wixui-rich-text__text">Confidentiality: Submissions to CRV are confidential and are not published documents.
