                    "Responsible AIFollowing the successful third edition of the\u00a0Responsible AI event in 2024, we are excited that the event will be held again in 2025. We strongly believe in the importance and urgency of the Responsible and Ethical Development of Artificial Intelligence for Social Good.\n\nAs outlined by the\u00a0UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, AI technology may have unintended by-products that lead to discrimination, reinforce inequalities, infringe upon human rights, socially sort and disrupt democratic processes, limit access to services and intensify surveillance and unfair treatment of marginalized and minority groups. As such, we are committed to organizing a cohesive and dynamic program that embodies the paradigm of responsible development of AI so that AI researchers and practitioners can engage in critical analysis and integration of fairness, ethics, transparency, and algorithmic accountability in their work.\u200bThis year's program will consist of the following events and will be open to all participants of the Canadian AI conference:\n\n\u200b\n\n\n\nThree Invited Talks of 30 minutes each. The talks will consist of speakers with practical and theoretical expertise at the intersection of various domains and Responsible AI\n\n\nA student 3-minute-thesis (3MT) competition\n\n\nA student research poster session\n\n\nA panel featuring leaders in Responsible AI\n\n\nA live AI Ethics debate\n\nResponsible AI Co-chairsEbrahim Bagheri\n\nProfessor\n\nFaculty of Information, University of Toronto\n\nWebsite\n\n\u200b\n\nZack Marshall\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nUniversity of Calgary\n\nWebsiteResponsible AI arrangements chairCalvin Hillis\n\nPhD Student\n\nToronto Metropolitan University\n\nWebsiteProgram Schedule27 May 2025\n\n\u200b\n\n09:00 \u2014 09:30\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Invited speaker 1\n\n09:30 \u2014 10:30\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Invited speakers 2 and 3\n\n10:30 \u2014 11:00\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Coffee\n\n11:00 \u2014 12:30\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03MT and Posters\n\n12:30 \u2014 14:00\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lunch and Posters\n\n14:00 \u2014 15:00\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Debates\n\n15:00 \u2014 15:30\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Coffee\n\n15:30 \u2014 17:00\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Panel\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200bWorkshop Location\u200b\n\n\n\nTaylor Institute, Room 110Invited speakersJulita VassilevaUniversity of SaskatchewanTalk title to be announcedBio\n\nJulita Vassileva is a professor at the University of Saskatchewan, focusing on human-centered AI . Her research spans user modeling, personalization, recommender systems, intelligent tutoring systems, multi-agent systems, social computing, trust and reputation mechanisms, persuasive technology, and behavior change. She has nearly 300 publications and has supervised over 60 graduate students. Additionally, she is the section editor of Frontiers in AI: Human Learning and Behaviour Change, co-editor of the HCI section of PeerJ Computer Science, and a member of the editorial boards of User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, International Journal of AI in Education, and ACM Transactions of Social Computing.Gideon ChristianUniversity of CalgaryTalk title to be announcedBio\n\nDr. Gideon Christian is an Associate Professor and University Research Chair in AI and Law at the University of Calgary. Prior to joining the University of Calgary, he was technology lawyer with the federal Department of Justice where he deployed technology in high profile litigation involving the Government of Canada. His research interests are in artificial intelligence and law, legal impacts of new and emerging technologies among other areas. Dr. Christian\u2019s research seeks to identify elements of racial bias in laws, policies and in emerging technologies. His current research seeks to develop the concept of algorithmic racism which is defined as race-based bias arising from the use of AI-powered tools in the analysis of data in decision making resulting in unfair outcomes to individuals from a particular segment of the society characterised by race. Dr. Christian has appeared before the House of Commons Committee on Citizenship and Immigration (CIMM) as an expert in the use of AI in immigration decisions. He was the Ontario Bar Association 2024 Chief Justice of Ontario Fellow in Research. He was named by the Calgary Herald as one of the top 20 Compelling Calgarians in 2024, and was awarded the ITL Trailblazer in Technology Award in 2025.Nils ForkertUniversity of CalgaryTalk title to be announcedBio\n\nDr. Nils Daniel Forkert, PhD, is a Professor at the University of Calgary in the Departments of Radiology and Clinical Neurosciences. He received his German diploma in Computer Science in 2009 from the University of Hamburg, his master\u2019s degree in medical physics in 2012 from the Technical University of Kaiserslautern, his PhD in computer science in 2013 from the University of Hamburg, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University before joining the University of Calgary as an Assistant Professor in 2014.
