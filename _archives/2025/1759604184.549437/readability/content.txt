Responsible AIFollowing the successful third edition of the Responsible AI event in 2024, we are excited that the event will be held again in 2025. We strongly believe in the importance and urgency of the Responsible and Ethical Development of Artificial Intelligence for Social Good.

As outlined by the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, AI technology may have unintended by-products that lead to discrimination, reinforce inequalities, infringe upon human rights, socially sort and disrupt democratic processes, limit access to services and intensify surveillance and unfair treatment of marginalized and minority groups. As such, we are committed to organizing a cohesive and dynamic program that embodies the paradigm of responsible development of AI so that AI researchers and practitioners can engage in critical analysis and integration of fairness, ethics, transparency, and algorithmic accountability in their work.​This year's program will consist of the following events and will be open to all participants of the Canadian AI conference:

​



Three Invited Talks of 30 minutes each. The talks will consist of speakers with practical and theoretical expertise at the intersection of various domains and Responsible AI


A student 3-minute-thesis (3MT) competition


A student research poster session


A panel featuring leaders in Responsible AI


A live AI Ethics debate

Taylor Institute, Room 110Invited speakersJulita VassilevaUniversity of SaskatchewanTalk title to be announcedBio

Julita Vassileva is a professor at the University of Saskatchewan, focusing on human-centered AI . Her research spans user modeling, personalization, recommender systems, intelligent tutoring systems, multi-agent systems, social computing, trust and reputation mechanisms, persuasive technology, and behavior change. She has nearly 300 publications and has supervised over 60 graduate students. Additionally, she is the section editor of Frontiers in AI: Human Learning and Behaviour Change, co-editor of the HCI section of PeerJ Computer Science, and a member of the editorial boards of User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, International Journal of AI in Education, and ACM Transactions of Social Computing.Gideon ChristianUniversity of CalgaryTalk title to be announcedBio

Dr. Gideon Christian is an Associate Professor and University Research Chair in AI and Law at the University of Calgary. Prior to joining the University of Calgary, he was technology lawyer with the federal Department of Justice where he deployed technology in high profile litigation involving the Government of Canada. His research interests are in artificial intelligence and law, legal impacts of new and emerging technologies among other areas. Dr. Christian’s research seeks to identify elements of racial bias in laws, policies and in emerging technologies. His current research seeks to develop the concept of algorithmic racism which is defined as race-based bias arising from the use of AI-powered tools in the analysis of data in decision making resulting in unfair outcomes to individuals from a particular segment of the society characterised by race. Dr. Christian has appeared before the House of Commons Committee on Citizenship and Immigration (CIMM) as an expert in the use of AI in immigration decisions. He was the Ontario Bar Association 2024 Chief Justice of Ontario Fellow in Research. He was named by the Calgary Herald as one of the top 20 Compelling Calgarians in 2024, and was awarded the ITL Trailblazer in Technology Award in 2025.Nils ForkertUniversity of CalgaryTalk title to be announcedBio

Dr. Nils Daniel Forkert, PhD, is a Professor at the University of Calgary in the Departments of Radiology and Clinical Neurosciences. He received his German diploma in Computer Science in 2009 from the University of Hamburg, his master’s degree in medical physics in 2012 from the Technical University of Kaiserslautern, his PhD in computer science in 2013 from the University of Hamburg, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University before joining the University of Calgary as an Assistant Professor in 2014. He is an imaging and machine learning scientist who develops new image processing methods, predictive algorithms, and software tools for the analysis of medical data. This includes the extraction of clinically relevant parameters and biomarkers from medical data describing the morphology and function of organs with the aim of supporting clinical studies and preclinical research as well as developing computer-aided diagnosis and patient-specific, precision-medicine, prediction models using machine learning based on multi-modal medical data. Dr. Forkert is a Canada Research Chair (Tier 2) in Medical Image Analysis, and Director of the Child Health Data Science Program of the Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute as well as the Theme Lead for Machine Learning in Neuroscience of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary.
