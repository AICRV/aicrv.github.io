We strongly believe in the importance and urgency of the Responsible and Ethical Development of Artificial Intelligence for Social Good. As outlined by the (https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics) UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence   , AI technology may have unintended by-products that lead to discrimination, reinforce inequalities, infringe upon human rights, socially sort and disrupt democratic processes, limit access to services and intensify surveillance and unfair treatment of marginalized and minority groups. As such, we are committed to organizing a cohesive and dynamic program that embodies the paradigm of responsible development of AI so that AI researchers and practitioners can engage in critical analysis and integration of fairness, ethics, transparency, and algorithmic accountability in their work.                    ​This year's program will consist of the following events and will be open to all participants of the Canadian AI conference: ​  Three Invited Talks of 30 minutes each.
