**Call for Workshops**

Location: Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada

Dates: May 25 - May 29, 2026


The 39th Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence (Canadian AI 2026) and 23rd Conference on Robots and Vision (CRV 2026) are pleased to invite proposals for workshops to be held alongside the main conference, which will be held from May 25–29, 2026. Workshops provide a platform for focused discussions, knowledge sharing, and collaboration on specific topics. In addition to the topics of interest for Canadian AI and CRV conferences, we also encourage proposals that foster interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research on applications of AI, and strongly support workshops that are co-chaired by researchers from different institutions to encourage cross-institutional collaboration and diversity in perspectives. 

This year we welcome events that don't follow traditional workshop formats (which we call "special topic forums"), in order to facilitate small-group discussions of preliminary ideas or results and to provide a venue for gathering feedback and meeting potential collaborators. Non-traditional formats include formats that are common in other fields, such as symposia, breakout sessions, working paper sessions and roundtables, and other formats that may be proposed by organizers. 

Please find more information below.

**Workshop Themes**: 

We invite proposals on a broad range of AI-related topics, as well as those focusing on novel application areas where AI can have a transformative impact. Workshops that bring together researchers from different disciplines and institutions are highly encouraged, as these collaborations can lead to groundbreaking insights and innovations. Proposals with co-organizers from multiple institutions are particularly welcomed, as they foster diverse perspectives and strengthen the interdisciplinary nature of the discussions to explore how AI can bridge gaps between disciplines and play a transformative role in addressing societal challenges.

**Workshop Format**: 

Workshops can be structured as full-day, half-day or quarter-day events and should promote interaction and collaboration. Suggested formats include a combination of invited talks, panel discussions, paper presentations, and breakout sessions to encourage deep dives into specific challenges or emerging topics.

**Proposal Submission Guidelines**: 

Workshop proposals should include the following information: ​ 
1. **Title** of the workshop. 
2. **Organizers**: Names, affiliations, and contact information of each organizer. Proposals with organizers from multiple institutions are highly encouraged.

4. **Format**: A proposed format (workshop, symposium, breakout session, working paper session, roundtable, etc.) and schedule outlining the structure of the event (keynotes, discussions, paper presentations, etc.). 
5. **Length**: full, half or quarter day
6. **Expected Number of Attendees**: Provide a rough estimate for space reservation.
7. **Timeline for Inviting and Reviewing Contributions**: The workshop paper decisions should be made before April 3, 2026, to enable contributors to register by the early registration deadline. We suggest setting aside at least two weeks for reviewing workshop contributions.
